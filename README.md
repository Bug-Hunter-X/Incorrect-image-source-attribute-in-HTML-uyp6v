# Uncommon HTML Error: Incorrect Image Source Attribute

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in HTML: using the incorrect attribute name for specifying the image source.  The correct attribute is `src`, not `scr`.

The `bug.html` file contains the error, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

This subtle error can prevent images from displaying correctly in web browsers, leading to broken layouts and a poor user experience.  Always double-check your attribute names to avoid such issues.
